File Finder - C++ Program

This C++ program searches for a specific file within a simulated file system using directories and subdirectories. It uses recursion to navigate through the hierarchical structure and find the target file.

Description

The program defines two structures:

	•	File: Represents a file with a name.
	•	Directory: Contains a list of files and subdirectories.

The findFile function recursively searches for a file in the directory structure and returns the path if found.
